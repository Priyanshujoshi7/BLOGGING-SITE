Project Description:
This project encapsulates the creation of a robust RESTful API for a user-friendly blogging platform, harnessing the power and efficiency of Python's FASTAPI framework. Designed to empower users with seamless interaction, the API facilitates essential actions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts, along with an array of additional functionalities.

The platform seamlessly integrates with a meticulously crafted frontend, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience. Leveraging Flask as the backend database technology, the project embodies a synergy of cutting-edge frameworks and technologies.

Object-oriented programming principles form the cornerstone of development, fostering maintainability, scalability, and extensibility throughout the project lifecycle. By adhering to these principles, the API architecture is engineered to promote code reusability, encapsulation, and modularity, thereby enhancing the overall quality and robustness of the system.

- Run the Application: Execute the main.py file using Python to start the FASTAPI server:
 py main.py

- Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:
 pip -r requirements.txt
